<h1>Recommendation System: Suggest Similar VR Experiences</h1>

<p>This project builds a content-based recommendation system to suggest similar VR experiences to users based on the features of the experiences they have interacted with. The system uses <strong>cosine similarity</strong> to measure the similarity between VR experiences based on their features.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The recommendation system is designed to help users find VR experiences similar to the ones they have already interacted with. By analyzing features such as the environment, interaction type, and duration, the system suggests experiences with similar characteristics.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Load and preprocess the dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Extract relevant features such as <em>environment</em>, <em>interaction type</em>, and <em>duration</em> from the VR experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate the <em>cosine similarity</em> between VR experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Recommend the most similar VR experiences to the user based on their current experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup and Installation</h2>
<p>To run the recommendation system, you will need Python and the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>pandas</code> - For data manipulation</li>
    <li><code>scikit-learn</code> - For calculating cosine similarity</li>
</ul>

<p>Install the required libraries by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>pip install pandas scikit-learn</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once you have the environment set up, you can run the recommendation system as follows:</p>
<pre><code>python recommendation.py</code></pre>

<h3>Key Components of the Recommendation System:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Loading:</strong> Load the VR experience data from the CSV file.</li>
    <li><strong>Cosine Similarity:</strong> Calculate similarity scores between experiences based on selected features.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation Function:</strong> Retrieve and display the most similar experiences.</li>
</ol>
